# ULLYSES
Python notebooks to work on Ullyses data

By providing the target name (e.g, AV 377) the code extracts Ullyses data in fits format from MAST archive through API. The code then converts fits spectra into text file format containing wavelength and flux information. Using this matplotlib widget option in this notebook you can interactively plot spectra. There is also an option to slice the spectra into small sections containing specific UV lines and plot them in velocity space.
