# ULLYSES
Python notebooks to work on Ullyses data

By giving the target name (e.g, AV 377) you can extracts Ullyses data in fits format from MAST archive using API. The code then convert it into text file containing wavelength and flux information. Using this matplotlib widget option in this notebook you can interactively plot spectra. There is also an option to slice the spectra into small regions containing specific UV lines and plot them in velocity space.
